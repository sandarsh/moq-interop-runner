# MoQ Interop Runner

A framework for testing interoperability between MoQT (Media over QUIC Transport) implementations.

## Why Interoperability Testing?

The IETF standards process requires "multiple, independent, and interoperable implementations" before a specification can advance ([RFC 2026](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2026)). Interop testing catches ambiguities in specs that only surface when different teams interpret the same text differently, and builds confidence that implementations will work together in real deployments.

This project is modeled on the [QUIC Interop Runner](https://github.com/quic-interop/quic-interop-runner), which was instrumental during QUIC standardization.

## Non-Goals

**Reference compliance testing.** This project tests whether different MoQT implementations can successfully communicate with each other - interoperability, not compliance. We're not building a reference implementation that serves as the definitive arbiter of spec compliance. Interop testing happens *between* implementations - if two implementations agree and work together, that's what we care about.

**Adversarial/negative testing.** Our test cases follow scenarios that occur between valid MoQT implementations. We don't require test clients to produce malformed messages or violate the protocol to test error handling. That kind of negative testing requires purpose-built tools capable of representing illegal protocol states - not something we expect from production MoQT implementations.

**Browser-based implementations (for now).** The current Docker-based flow assumes CLI execution. Browser-only implementations (TypeScript/WebTransport) can't plug in directly today. Playwright-based automation is a potential future direction.

## Getting Started

New to the project? See **[Getting Started](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md)** for a guided walkthrough — from running your first test to registering your implementation.

Run `make help` to see all available commands.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** with buildx support (for building multi-platform images)
- **jq** (for parsing JSON configuration)
- **openssl** (for generating TLS certificates)
- **bash** (works with macOS default bash 3.2+)

## Overview

This project provides:

- **Implementation Registry** (`implementations.json`) - A catalog of MoQT implementations with their capabilities, Docker images, and public relay endpoints
- **Test Orchestration** - Scripts to run interop tests across implementation combinations
- **Test Specifications** (`docs/TEST-SPECIFICATIONS.md`) - Standardized test cases that any implementation can implement

## Quick Start

```bash
# List registered implementations and their endpoints
make interop-list

# Build the moq-rs test client (one-time, takes a few minutes)
make build-moq-rs BUILD_ARGS="--target client"

# Run tests against all public relays
make interop-remote
```

To narrow to one relay's remote endpoints: `./run-interop-tests.sh --remote-only --relay moxygen`.

See [Getting Started](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md) for a fuller walkthrough, or run `make help` to see all commands.

This table is a snapshot — run `make interop-list` or see [`implementations.json`](./implementations.json) for the current state. See [IMPLEMENTATIONS.md](./IMPLEMENTATIONS.md) for how to add your implementation.

## Test Cases

Tests are organized by functional category:

| Test | Category | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| `setup-only` | Session | Connect, complete SETUP exchange, close gracefully |
| `announce-only` | Namespace | Announce namespace, receive OK, close |
| `publish-namespace-done` | Namespace | Announce, then send PUBLISH_NAMESPACE_DONE |
| `subscribe-error` | Subscription | Subscribe to non-existent track, expect error |
| `announce-subscribe` | Subscription | Publisher announces, subscriber subscribes |
| `subscribe-before-announce` | Subscription | Subscribe before publisher announces |

See [docs/tests/TEST-CASES.md](./docs/tests/TEST-CASES.md) for detailed specifications with protocol references.
